# Subscribe Screen Share over Stream Manager using Red5 Pro

This is an example subscribing to a broadcast with screen sharing. It is very similar to how you would subscribe to a video broadcast. However, this example makes to consumer connections: one for the screen share and one for the audio. This is due to the fact that is it not possible at the time of this writing (_November 30th, 2017_) to provide a valid media constraint with both audio an screen sharing.

**Please refer to the [Basic Subscriber Documentation](../subscribeStreamManagerProxy/README.md) to learn more about the basic setup.**

## Example Code

# How to Subscribe

First launch the [Publisher Screen Share Test](../publishStreamManagerProxyScreenShare) in a separate window/tab and follow the extension installation requirements (depending on your browser).
